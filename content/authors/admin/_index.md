Anne Polyakov is a PhD student within the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management Program at the University of Washington. Her research focuses on modeling the role of mycorrhizal fungi in the carbon and nitrogen cycles, mycorrhizal fungal networks, and using stable isotope analysis to model these phenomena. Her primary adviser is Dr. Andrew Berdahl in the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences, and her other committee members include faculty from both the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences and the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences.
