Welcome! My name is Anne Polyakov and I am a PhD student within the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management Program at the University of Washington. My research focuses on modeling the role of mycorrhizal fungi in carbon and nitrogen cycling, especially fungal-plant trading dynamics through mycorrhizal fungal networks, using a combination of field work, genetic sequencing, stable isotope analysis, and statistical modeling. Specifically, I am examining the role of fungal communities in the salmon forests of SW Alaska. My primary adviser is Dr. Andrew Berdahl in the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences, and my other committee members include Dr. Gordon Holtgrieve from the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, Dr. Kristiina Vogt, Dr. Daniel Vogt, and Dr. Brittany Johnson from the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, Dr. Erik Lilleskov from Michigan Technological University and Dr. Erik Hobbie from the University of New Hampshire.
