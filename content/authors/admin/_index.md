Welcome! My name is Anne Polyakov and I am a PhD candidate within the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management Program at the University of Washington. My research involves using a variety of modeling techniques to understand ecological processes, with an emphasis on the role of mycorrhizal fungi in carbon and nitrogen cycling. My current projects include using machine learning to predict forest carbon allocation belowground to fungal symbionts, network analysis to model the structure and function of mycorrhizal fungal networks, and mechanistic modeling to trace the distribution of salmon-derived nutrients through fungal-plant systems.. I am especially interested in using state of the art modeling approaches to understand fungal processes and contribute to research on fungal biodiversity and conservation. Some of my other work includes modeling population dynamics of small mammals, examining biodiversity conservation in the agricultural matrix, and quantifying collective behavior in Pacific salmon. My doctoral research centers on quantifying fungal-plant trading dynamics through mycorrhizal fungal networks using a combination of field work, genomics, stable isotope biogeochemistry, and modeling. Specifically, I am examining the role of fungal communities in the salmon forests of Alaska.
