Welcome! My name is Anne Polyakov and I am a PhD student within the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management Program at the University of Washington. My research focuses on modeling the role of mycorrhizal fungi in carbon and nitrogen cycling, using a combination of field work, genetic sequencing, stable isotope analysis, and statistical modeling. Specifically, I am examining the role of fungal communities in the salmon forests of SW Alaska. My primary adviser is Dr. Andrew Berdahl in the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences, and my other committee members include faculty from both the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences and the School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, as well as Michigan State University and the University of New Hampshire.
